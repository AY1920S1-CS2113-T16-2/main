== Introduction

El Duque is a desktop task manager made for computing students. More importantly, El Duque is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, El Duque can organise your life better than anything else. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `El-Duque.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your personal Task Manager.
.  Open the command line and navigate to the selected folder and type `java -jar El-Duque.jar` to run El Duque.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will show you a brief summary of commands and their format
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `list` : lists all tasks
* `task example` : adds a task with a description called example to the task manager
* `delete 3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list
* `bye` : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
El Duque relies on a flexible command line syntax to parse in commands. Here is the general form of that said syntax.

    [-FILTER] COMMAND [-MODIFICATIONS]

There are 3 main parts to the syntax and filter and modifications have to be prefixed with `-`. Filter and modifications are optional. They serve to add extra depth to the basic commands.
You can think of filters as sublists. To learn more filters, go to Section 4.5, “Project Filters”. One very important point to note is that `INDEX` is relative to `FILTER`. 

For example: +
 `edit 3 -description do laundry` can be doing exactly the same thing as `-housechores edit 1 -description do laundry` if the first task in housechores filter tasklist is the same as the third task in the overall tasklist.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `task DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `task example`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `DESCRIPTION [-p PRIORITY]` can be used as `task example -p high` or as `task example`.
* All optional modifications except FILTER can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `task DESCRIPTION [-p PRIORITY] [-t DATETIME]`, `task DESCRIPTION [-t DATETIME] [-p PRIORITY]` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

    help

=== Adding a task: `task`
Adds a task to the task manager. +

 [-FILTER] task DESCRIPTION [-p PRIORITY] [-t DATETIME] [-d DURATION] [-r RECURRENCE]

Modifications at the back are optional, feel free to use them if you wish.

    task ST2334 Tutorial

If you wish to add a task to the `CS2113` list.

    -CS2113 task Project Meeting -p high -t tomorrow 1400 -r weekly

[NOTE]
Only one word filters are allowed.

=== Adding an event: `event`
Adds an event to the task manager. Events support the same functionalities of task but they have a compulsary date time modification.

    event Student Life Fair -t tomorrow 1000

=== Modifications

==== Priority
Priority tagging for tasks have 3 levels. `l` , `m` and `h` to represent low, medium and high respectively. +

    -p h

[NOTE]
Feel free to type `low`, `medium` or `high` as well, El Duque understands.

==== Recurring Tasks
Recurring tasks are tasks that will mark itself as undone after the recurrence period.
A daily task will be refreshed daily, saving you the trouble of having to recreate the task every day.
Recurrence periods supported are `daily` and `weekly`.

    -r daily

==== Duration
Duration assigned to task denotes the amount of time in hours you assigned for the task.

    -d 5

==== Date and Time
Date and time input follows the following formats: `ddMMyy` or `ddMMyy HHmm`. +

    -t 071119 1000

El Duque also supports keywords `today`,  `tomorrow` and `today/tomorrow HHmm` as well. +

    -t tomorrow 1200

=== Listing all tasks : `list`
Shows a list of all tasks in the task manager. +

    list

==== Filtered List
Adding a `-FILTER` infront of the list command will show the respective filtered list. +

    -CS2113 list

==== Time-Based List
List based on certain time frames are also included: `day` and `week`. +

    list day

==== Uncompleted List
List based on completion of task: `undone`

    list undone

==== Priority List
List based on priority: `priority`

    list priority

=== Completing a task : `done`
Completes an existing task in the address book. +

    done INDEX

[NOTE]
Only valid indexes will work! If you try to perform the command using an index not shown in the current list, the task manager will ask you to type in a valid index!

This following command marks the first task in the list as complete.

    done 1

Filters can be used with this command as well as shown.

    -CS2113 done 2

Will mark the second task in the -CS2113 list as done.

=== Locating tasks by description: `find`

Finds task whose description contain any of the given keywords. +

    [-FILTER] find KEYWORD

The task manager supports partial matching in the search operation. +

    find bo

Will return tasks that have "bo" in the description.

=== Auto assign: `autoassign`
You can auto assign tasks that have yet to have filters using certain heuristics.
This feature relies on filter name matching or having similar description words.
For example, if `cs` filter has many tasks with description contatining "programming", auto assigning a task with "programming" in the description will suggest `cs` as a filter.

    autoassign 2

=== Editing a task : `edit`
El Duque supports the editing of any parameters of a given task.
The parameters to be edited must begin with `-KEYWORD` followed by the edit.

    [-FILTER] edit INDEX -KEYWORD [MODIFICATION]

Editing the description and recurrence of the first task of the list is as follows. +

    edit 1 -desc gym -r daily

[NOTE]
The order of the parameters does not matter!

Shown below are the list of keywords and the respective attributes that they edit.

* `-f` : filter
* `-des` / `-desc` / `-descript` : description
* `priority` : priority
* `t` : date and time
* `d` : duration of the task
* `r` : recurrence

=== Deleting a task : `delete`

Deletes the specified task from the task manager. +

 [-FILTER] delete INDEX

****
* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

    list
    delete 2

Deletes the 2nd task in the task list.

    -CS2113 list
    -CS2113 delete 1

Deletes the 1st task in the list shown by the `-CS2113 list` command.


// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the task manager to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +

    undo

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the address book's content (`task`, `event`, `edit`, `delete` and `done`).
====

    delete 1
    list
    undo

This will reverse the `delete 1` command.

    list
    undo

The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

    delete 1
    edit 2 -p high
    undo
    undo

This first undo will reverse the `delete 1` command. +
The second undeo will reverse the `edit 2 -p high` command. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Pomodoro Timer
El Duque includes a pomodoro timer to complement the pomodoro workflow.
This timer has 3 states, *work*, *short break* and *long break*.
A work cycle is followed by a *short break*, every 4th break will be a *long break*. +

Pomodoro supports the adding of task to a temporary pomodoro task list for you to keep track of tasks you wish to complete this pomodoro work session. +


==== Starting a pomodoro: `start`

    pomo start

El Duque will subsequently update you on the time remaining for the current state every 5 minutes.

[NOTE]

The following command adds the first task of the task list into the pomodoro.

    pomo add 1

[TIP]
Filters are supported as well. `-CS2113 pomo add 1` will add the first task in the CS2113 task list.

El Duque contains a bank of brain teasers that will be shown every time a break has started.
