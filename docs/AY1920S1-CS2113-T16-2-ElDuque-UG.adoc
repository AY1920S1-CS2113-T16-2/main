== Introduction

El Duque is a desktop task manager made for computing students. More importantly, El Duque is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, El Duque can organise your life better than anything else. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `El-Duque.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your personal Task Manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The CLI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will show you a brief summary of commands and their format
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tasks
* **`task`**`example` : adds a task with a description called example to the task manager
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list
* *`bye`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
El Duque relies on a flexible command line syntax to parse in commands. Here is the general form of that said syntax.

`[-FILTER] COMMAND [-MODIFICATIONS]`

There are 3 main parts to the syntax and filter and modifications have to be prefixed with `-`. Filter and modifications are optional. They serve to add extra depth to the basic commands.
You can think of filters as sublists. To learn more filters, go to Section 4.5, “Project Filters”. One very important point to note is that `INDEX` is relative to `FILTER`. 

For example: +
 `edit 3 -description do laundry` can be doing exactly the same thing as `-housechores edit 1 -description do laundry` if the first task in housechores filter tasklist is the same as the third task in the overall tasklist.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `task DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `task example`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `DESCRIPTION [-p PRIORITY]` can be used as `task example -p high` or as `task example`.
* All optional modifications except FILTER can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `task DESCRIPTION [-p PRIORITY] [-t DATETIME]`, `task DESCRIPTION [-t DATETIME] [-p PRIORITY]` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a task: `add`

Adds a task to the address book +
Format: `[-FILTER] task DESCRIPTION [-p PRIORITY] [-t DATETIME] [-d DURATION] [-r RECURRENCE]`

[TIP]
A task can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `task ST2334 Tutorial`
* `-CS2113 task Project Meeting -p high -t tomorrow 1400 -r weekly`

=== Listing all tasks : `list`

Shows a list of all tasks in the task manager. +
Format: `list`

=== Completing a task : `done`

Completes an existing task in the address book. +
Format: `done INDEX`

[NOTE]
Only valid indexes will work! If you try to perform the command using an index not shown in the current list, the task manager will ask you to type in a valid index!

Examples:

* `done 1` +
Completes the 1st task shown in the current list.
* `done 12` +
Completes the task at index 12 shown in the current list.

=== Locating tasks by description: `find`

Finds task whose description contain any of the given keywords. +
The task manager supports partial matching in the search operation. +
If there is no exact match found, the task manager will list all partial matches. +
Format: `[-FILTER] find KEYWORD`

=== Deleting a task : `delete`

Deletes the specified task from the task manager. +
Format: `[-FILTER] delete INDEX`

****
* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd task in the address book.
* `-CS2113 list` +
`-CS2113 delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st task in the list shown by the `-CS2113 list` command.


// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the task manager to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the address book's content (`task`, `event`, `edit`, `delete` and `done`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`edit 2 -p high` +
`undo` (reverses the `edit 2 -p high` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Exiting the program : `bye`

Exits the program. +
Format: `bye`

=== Saving the data

El Duque data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.
